function [ overfit_m ] = computeOverfitMeasure( true_Q_f, N_train, N_test, var, num_expts )
%COMPUTEOVERFITMEASURE Compute how much worse H_10 is compared with H_2 in
%terms of test error. Negative number means it's better.
%   Inputs
%       true_Q_f: order of the true hypothesis
%       N_train: number of training examples
%       N_test: number of test examples
%       var: variance of the stochastic noise
%       num_expts: number of times to run the experiment
%   Output
%       overfit_m: vector of length num_expts, reporting each of the
%                  differences in error between H_10 and H_2
